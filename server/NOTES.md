# Features

- Main Page:
  - Should look similar to my last portfolio page, except it will list articles in descending order, starting with my most recent.
  - Each article should have a title (required), a subtitle (optional), a main body, a creation date, a last-edited date, and tags
    - Consider adding a category - it will allow for sorting articles into subject areas (e.g. Climate Change or Advaita). It can default to "none" or something like that.
  - Logged in users should be able to privately tag other people's articles for their own future reference
  - There should be a search feature to search by title, author, or tag(s)
    - title and author search should work with partial searches and should be searchable together (i.e. this article by this author)
    - search by multiple tags will only find articles with both tags
